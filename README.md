# KaiScr
## Small Python scripts to take screenshot from a KaiOS/FFOS device and to mirror the screen of your phone.

A video on how to use it from myself:
http://far.chickenkiller.com/files/using-kailive-and-kaiscr.mp4 （expired）（  https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Q54y1a7qN  ）

### kaiscr.py
Just run the script with `-h`:
```
python3 kaiscr.py -h
```

### kailive.py
Just run the script and make sure you have forwarded the debug socket
to port 6000(TCP):
```
python3 kailive.py
```
Press `q` to quit.
